The point of this code is to be a refresher on the C language.  It has an array of data and will perform various statistical analysis on the data array.
    * Min
    * Max
    * Median
    * Mean (avg)

## Usage

A `makefile` is included in the folder to make compiling the code easier.

To just compile the code using gcc, issue the following command:
```bash
make
```

To run to compiled code, run the following command in a linux shell:
```bash
./main
```

If you want to compile **and** run in one line, issue the following command:
```bash
make run
```
